# 100_days_of_code

On 9/29/2020 I decided to code every day for 100 days. I code quite often but I do not document it. Now I will.

### Rules

- I will push code or researched materiale to GitHub every day to monitor my progress.
- I will update my activity `log.md` with the day's progress and provide links for tracking, etc.

### Folders/Files

1. /work_folder
2. log.md
3. resources.md
